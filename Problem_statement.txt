Data integration in SPSS Modeler refers to the systematic process of combining data from multiple disparate sources into a unified, consistent, and comprehensive dataset suitable for advanced analytics. This process involves various operations that transform, consolidate, and refine raw data into actionable information. The primary operations include:

Merge Operations: Joining datasets horizontally based on common key fields (such as Customer ID), enabling the combination of related information from different sources into a single record. This is analogous to SQL JOIN operations.

Append Operations: Stacking datasets vertically to combine records from multiple sources or time periods, creating a comprehensive historical view of data.

Aggregate Operations: Summarizing transactional or detailed data by grouping records and applying statistical functions (sum, count, average, etc.) to create higher-level analytical units.

Sampling Operations: Selecting representative subsets of data to improve processing efficiency while maintaining statistical validity.

These integration operations collectively help in removing duplicate records, consolidating information from multiple sources, creating unified datasets for comprehensive analysis, and ensuring data quality and consistency. The result is a single source of truth that provides a 360-degree view of the analytical subject, enabling more accurate predictive modeling and business intelligence.
